# Image-Colorization-Using-OpenCV-and-Deep-Learning
This project involves preparing and processing a dataset of images for use in machine learning models. The dataset consists of black-and-white and color images stored in a directory and is designed for image-to-image translation, enhancement, or classification tasks.
